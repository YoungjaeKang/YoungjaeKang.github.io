I took the lead in various tasks such as strategy, sales, marketing, and PM until the number of startups with 8 members became 130 and listed on the KOSDAQ market. In particular, I contributed to the process of innovating the traditional business of art brokerage online.

Currently, I work in the business planning department of a KOSPI-listed manufacturing company. I learned how to look at business from a bigger perspective than before. We have been able to adjust our product portfolio or analyze our performance on a per-affiliate basis.

As the problem that needs to be solved becomes more complex and larger, I want to solve it from various perspectives.
